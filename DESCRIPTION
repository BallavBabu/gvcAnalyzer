Description: Comprehensive toolkit for measuring global value chain (GVC) 
    participation using the Borin-Mancini frameworks. Implements BM 2023 
    trade-based decomposition (Borin & Mancini, 2023, <doi:10.1016/j.jinteco.2023.103811>) 
    which decomposes gross exports into domestic and foreign value-added components 
    with double-counting correction, and BM 2025 output-based decomposition which 
    measures GVC participation through production structures. Both frameworks 
    distinguish pure-forward, pure-backward, and two-sided GVC activities, enabling 
    analysis of countries' positions in global supply chains at national and 
    sectoral levels. Designed for researchers analyzing international trade, 
    industrial organization, and economic development using multi-regional 
    input-output (MRIO) data such as WIOD, OECD-ICIO, or ADB-MRIO.
