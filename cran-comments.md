## Response to CRAN Review
* **Non-standard files:** I have added 'docs', '_pkgdown.yml', and 'cran-comments.md' to .Rbuildignore to fix the top-level files note.
* **Misspelled words:** 'Borin' and 'Taglioni' are the surnames of the authors of the methodological papers cited. 'GVC' is the standard acronym for Global Value Chain, defined in the Description.

## Reverse dependencies
This is a new package, so there are no reverse dependencies.
