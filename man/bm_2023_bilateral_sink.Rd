\title{BM_2023 sink-based bilateral decomposition of exports from s to r}
\usage{
bm_2023_bilateral_sink(io, s, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{io}{bm_io object as returned by \code{bm_build_io()}}

\item{s}{exporter (country index or code, e.g. 1 or "China")}

\item{r}{importer (country index or code, e.g. 2 or "India")}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row for the pair (s,r):
\itemize{
\item \code{DVAsink_sr} Domestic VA of exporter \eqn{s} in \eqn{e_{sr}} that is finally
absorbed somewhere in the world as ultimate final demand.
\item \code{DDCsink_sr} Double-counting associated with exporter \eqn{s} in \eqn{e_{sr}}
due to the circulation of s's exports along GVC chains.
\item \code{FVAsink_sr} Foreign VA in \eqn{e_{sr}} from \eqn{t \ne s}.
\item \code{FDCsink_sr} Foreign double-counting in \eqn{e_{sr}}.
\item \code{EX_sr}      Gross exports \eqn{e_{sr}} (scalar).
}
}
\description{
Decomposes gross exports \eqn{e_{sr}} (from exporter \eqn{s} to importer \eqn{r}) from the
importer (sink) perspective using the BM_2023 /s formulation:
}
\details{
\deqn{u_N \times e_{sr} = DVAsink\_sr + DDCsink\_sr + FVAsink\_sr + FDCsink\_sr}

where the split between \eqn{e^{(s/ \to y^*)}_{sr}} (ultimate shipments)
and \eqn{e^{(\to e_s^*)}_{sr}} (re-exports of s's exports) follows
Equations (12)–(13) in BM_2023, constructed with the exporter-based
slash matrix A^/s (and B^/s).
