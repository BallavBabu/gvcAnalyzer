bm_gvc_pb_output(io, s)
}
\arguments{
\item{io}{A \code{bm_io} object.}

\item{s}{Country (index or name).}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar: pure-backward GVC-related output of s.
}

For a given country s, this function computes the pure-backward
GVC-related output, interpreted as foreign value added embodied
in s's output that is ultimately absorbed abroad in a one-border
GVC pattern.

\details{
This follows the BM_2025 style expression using:
\itemize{
\item Y_s_total = Σ_z Y_sz
\item Y_ss      = Y_ss
\item A_jk, B_ks, L_jj, L_ss blocks.
}
}
